Keys in `construct.yaml` file:
==============================

This document describes each of they keys in the `construct.yaml` file,
which is the main configuration file of a constructor configuration
directory.

All keys are optional, except otherwise noted.  Also, the keys `specs`
and `packages` take either a list of items, or a path to a file,
which contains one item per line (excluding lines starting with `#`).

Also note, that any line in `construct.yaml` may contain a selector at the
end, in order to allow customization for selected platforms.

'''

# list of tuples (key name, required, type, description)
KEYS = [
    ('name',                   True,  str, '''
Name of the installer.  May also contain uppercase letter.  The installer
name is independent of the names of any of the conda packages the installer
is composed of.
'''),

    ('company',                   False,  str, '''
Name of the organization/owner of the installer. The installer will show
this string in the footer. Defaults to 'Unknown'.
'''),

    ('version',                True,  str, '''
Version of the installer.  Just like the installer name, this version
is independent of any conda package versions contained in the installer.
'''),

    ('channels',               False, list, '''
The conda channels from which packages are retrieved, when using the `specs`
key below, but also when using the `packages` key ,unless the full URL is
given in the `packages` list (see below).
'''),

    ('specs',                  False, (list, str), '''
List of package specifications, e.g. `python 2.7*`, `pyzmq` or `numpy >=1.8`.
This list of specifications if given to the conda resolver (as if you were
to create a new environment with those specs.
'''),

    ('exclude',                False, list, '''
List of package names to be excluded, after the '`specs` have been resolved.
For example, you can say that `readline` should be excluded, even though it
is contained as a result of resolving the specs for `python 2.7`.
'''),

    ('packages',               False, (list, str), '''
A list of explicit conda packages to be included, e.g. `yaml-0.1.6-0.tar.bz2`.
The packages may also be specified by their entire URL,
e.g.`https://repo.continuum.io/pkgs/free/osx-64/openssl-1.0.1k-1.tar.bz2`.
Optionally, the MD5 hash sum of the package, may be added after an immediate
`#` character, e.g. `readline-6.2-2.tar.bz2#0801e644bd0c1cd7f0923b56c52eb7f7`.
'''),

    ('menu_packages',           False, list, '''
Packages for menu items will be installed (if the conda package contains the
necessary metadata in "Menu/<package name>.json").  Menu items are currently
only supported on Windows.  By default, all menu items will be installed.
'''),

    ('install_in_dependency_order', False, bool, '''
By default the conda packages included in the created installer are installed
in alphabetical order, Python is always installed first for technical
reasons.  Using this option, the packages are installed in their dependency
order (unless the explicit list in `packages` is used).
'''),

    ('conda_default_channels', False, list, '''
You can list conda channels here which will be the default conda channels
of the created installer (if it includes conda).
'''),

    ('installer_filename',     False, str, '''
The filename of the installer being created.  A reasonable default filename
will determined by the `name`, `version`, platform and installer type.
'''),

    ('web_environment',           False, str, '''
Path to a conda environment file to install into the installation. Note that
this file is used on the installation side, allowing for packages to be
fetched over the network.
'''),

    ('license_file',           False, str, '''
Path to the license file being displayed by the installer during the install
process.
'''),

    ('keep_pkgs',              False, bool, '''
By default, no conda packages are preserved after running the created
installer in the `pkgs` directory.  Using this option changes the default
behavior.
'''),

    ('pre_install',            False, str, '''
Path to a pre install (bash - Unix only) script.
'''),

    ('post_install',           False, str, '''
Path to a post install (bash for Unix - .bat for Windows) script.
'''),

    ('default_prefix',         False, str, 'XXX'),

    ('welcome_image',          False, str, '''
Path to an image (in any common image format `.png`, `.jpg`, `.tif`, etc.)
which is used as the welcome image for the Windows installer.
The image is re-sized to 164 x 314 pixels.
By default, an image is automatically generated.
'''),

    ('header_image',           False, str, '''
Like `welcome_image` for Windows, re-sized to 150 x 57 pixels.
'''),

    ('icon_image',             False, str, '''
Like `welcome_image` for Windows, re-sized to 256 x 256 pixels.
'''),

    ('default_image_color',    False, str, '''
The color of the default images (when not providing explicit image files)
used on Windows.  Possible values are `red`, `green`, `blue`, `yellow`.
The default is `blue`.
'''),
